Code to run the physical KTANE homage maze module

This set of python3 files provides the software functionality for the physical maze module connecting to a KTANE homage server.

The physical maze is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi with a SenseHat.

Beyond that, the only configuration needed is to point the bomb_network object at the IP address of the homage server.
